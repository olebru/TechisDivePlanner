Refactoring Mikes translation of Erik C. Bakers original Fortran implementation.


    /// <summary>
    /// Translation of Erik Baker's FORTRAN DecoCalc program into C#
    /// 
    /// For a full explanation of the program and the original source code, see http://www.ddplan.com/reference/decolessons.pdf
    /// 
    ///	This program is essentially a straight "transliteration" of Erik's program. It was intentionally kept
    ///	as close as possible to the original FORTRAN coding as possible. I realize that this makes the program somewhat
    ///	"ugly" and harder to read for people familiar with C#, but I wanted to stay true to the great work that Erik did on the 
    ///	original program and reduce the possibility for introducing bugs.
    ///

    Far from usable.
